                            applications (dapps). Dapps provide users with easy-to-use applications that guarantee the security

                            NEAR is building the infrastructure for the decentralized web, including the NEAR Protocol Smart
                            Contract platform plus a variety of other supporting tools. NEAR is a scalable blockchain designed
                            to provide the performance and user experience required to bridge the gaps in the mainstream

                            blockchain-based platforms, is built from the ground up, to be the easiest in the world for both
                            developers and their end-users, at the same time, providing the scalability and security needed to
                            serve those users. Specifically, NEAR's architecture makes it easier to: <br> <br>
