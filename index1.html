            <p> <strong>How it work</strong><br>
                NEAR provides a community-operated cloud-based infrastructure for deploying and running dapps by
                combining the features of a decentralized database with a serverless computing platform. The NEAR
                token, which allows this platform to run, also enables applications built on it to interact with
                each other. <br>

        <p> Together, these features allow developers to create censorship-resistant smart contracts for applications
            that <br> deal with high-end data like money, identity, assets, and open-state components that need to interact <br>
            seamlessly with each other. The infrastructure which makes up this cloud is created
            from a potentially <br> infinite number of "nodes" run by individuals and organizations who offer portions of
            their CPU and hard drive <br> space — whether on a laptop or, more likely, professionally deployed servers.

                The NEAR platform has been designed to be used in a permissionless way. However, a set of
                community-built tools and reference guides have been created to help developers.
                The NEAR team provides a set of straightforward command-line tools to enable developers to easily
                create, test and deploy applications from their local environments.

        <p>NEAR also uses existing technology, Gitpod, to create zero time onboarding experience for <br> developers. Gitpod
            provides an online "Integrated Development Environment" <br> (IDE), which NEAR customized to allow developers to
            easily write, test and deploy <br> smart contracts from a web browser.
            Very importantly, NEAR has the solutions for <br> scaling by eliminating the barriers to Web 3 adoption. With
            high speeds, low fees, <br> and progressive UX, NEAR's climate-neutral blockchain is ready for explosive growth. <br>
            Also, NEAR is set for a multi-chain future, as it runs in concert with Ethereum, <br> Polkadot, Cosmos, and more,
            allowing for the free flow of assets and communication <br> between networks for the betterment of all.

            ecosystem built for mass adoption. <br> Every

             achieved by providing a security model for wallet interactions and <br>
            giving developers more opportunities to create experiences that closely <br> resemble applications and

            Usability for developers is attained by setting up the protocol to allow <br> browser-based debugging, familiar
